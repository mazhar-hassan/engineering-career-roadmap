# Design Patterns
This is an important weapon in your arsnel and you must learn them to make your code better and increse your exposure to coding.

## S.O.L.I.D SOLID Design Principle
Start with the SOLID design principle, if you are not an expert in SOLID, you should not claim you want to become the best engineer.

### [ S ] - Single Responsibility
If you are happy and you know it, your code will surely show it.

### [ O ] - Open for extension and Closed for modification
Most misunderstood concept

### [ L ] - Liskov's subsituation method
She had a PHD when I was born :)
Every child class is a child of its Parent class, whats the catch here?

### [ I ] - Interface segrigation
Do you have any practicle example in your mind?

### [ D ] - Dependency Injection
Your code should not reply on concrete classes, and life cycle management of the object, hence relevent object can be passed to code logic.

# Anti Patterns
> We have a fix cost and hard-deadline project, lets do it agile way - The blunder of the worlds 

This requires a separate detailed article and is very important for you to learn, what not to do.
